### Project Title: **Healthcare Data Analysis and Optimization**

**Project Description:**  
This project involved performing comprehensive data analysis on a healthcare dataset to derive actionable insights for improving hospital operations, patient care, and resource management. Using SQL, various queries and operations were executed to analyze patient demographics, medical conditions, billing, and hospital preferences. Additionally, a stored procedure was created to match universal blood donors with recipients, ensuring efficient and timely medical support.

**Key Outcomes:**  
1. **Data-Driven Insights:**  
   - Identified patterns in patient demographics (e.g., age-wise distribution, medical conditions).  
   - Highlighted the most utilized hospitals, insurance providers, and medications.  
   - Analyzed average billing amounts and hospital stay durations.  

2. **Improved Patient Management:**  
   - Ranked hospitals based on patient admissions and discharge efficiency.  
   - Categorized patients by risk levels, enabling better prioritization of care.  
   - Matched blood donors with recipients to streamline emergency responses.  

3. **Operational Optimization:**  
   - Provided metrics for hospital performance in 2024 and 2025.  
   - Offered insights into medication use and treatment outcomes.  

**Tasks Performed:**  
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Counted total records and performed aggregation to analyze age distribution, medical conditions, and hospital preferences.  
   - Used SQL functions like `MAX`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, and `GROUP BY` to derive summary statistics.  

2. **Ranking and Sorting:**
   - Employed `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` functions to prioritize hospitals, age groups, and medications based on patient counts.  

3. **Categorization and Segmentation:**
   - Implemented `CASE` statements to categorize patients as high, medium, or low risk based on test results.  

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Analyzed hospital admissions by year, uncovering trends for 2024 and 2025.  
   - Investigated patient billing and hospital stay durations for efficient resource allocation.  

5. **Procedure Development:**
   - Designed a stored procedure to match universal blood donors (`O-`) with universal recipients (`AB+`), prioritizing the same hospital for matches.  

6. **Data Validation:**
   - Ensured accuracy by testing queries on subsets of the dataset and handling NULL values in critical columns.  

7. **Reporting and Visualization:**
   - Generated structured outputs from SQL queries for easy interpretation and integration into business intelligence tools.  

This project highlights the use of SQL for healthcare analytics and demonstrates how data can be leveraged to improve operational efficiency and patient outcomes.
